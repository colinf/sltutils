# Speech & Language Therapy Utilities

This is a collection of utilities for speech and language therapists. It is currently a collection made up of just one simple utility - a client-side javascript browser application to calculate the age in years and months of a child based on date of birth and current date (or other date).

The application is built using [component.js](http://cl.ly/Kn1z).
