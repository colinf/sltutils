# Speech & Language Therapy Utilities

This is my collection of utilities for speech and language therapists. It is currently a collection made up of just one simple utility - a static javascript web application to calculate the age in years and months of a child based on date of birth and current date (or other date).

### Try it out
You can try it at on the demonstration site.
